       "'Efficient Algorithms for Non-convex Isotonic\\nRegression through Submodular Optimization\\nFrancis Bach\\nInria\\nDépartement d’Informatique de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure\\nPSL Research University, Paris, France\\nfrancis.bach@ens.fr\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe consider the minimization of submodular functions subject to ordering constraints. We show that this potentially non-convex optimization problem can be cast\\nas a convex optimization problem on a space of uni-dimensional measures, with\\nordering constraints corresponding to first-order stochastic dominance. We propose\\nnew discretization schemes that lead to simple and efficient algorithms based on\\nzero-th, first, or higher order oracles; these algorithms also lead to improvements\\nwithout isotonic constraints. Finally, our experiments show that non-convex loss\\nfunctions can be much more robust to outliers for isotonic regression, while still\\nbeing solvable in polynomial time.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nShape constraints such as ordering constraints appear everywhere in estimation problems in machine\\nlearning, signal processing and statistics. They typically correspond to prior knowledge, and are\\nimposed for the interpretability of models, or to allow non-parametric estimation with improved\\nconvergence rates [16, 8]. In this paper, we focus on imposing ordering constraints into an estimation\\nproblem, a setting typically referred to as isotonic regression [4, 26, 22], and we aim to generalize\\nthe set of problems for which efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms exist.\\nWe thus focus on the following optimization problem:\\nmin H(x) such that 8(i, j) 2 E, xi > xj ,\\n\\nx2[0,1]n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere E ⇢ {1, . . . , n}2 represents the set of constraints, which form a directed acyclic graph. For\\nsimplicity, we restrict x to the set [0, 1]n , but our results extend to general products of (potentially\\nunbounded) intervals.\\nAs convex constraints, isotonic constraints are well-adapted to estimation problems formulated as\\nconvex optimization problems where H is convex, such as for linear supervised learning problems,\\nwith many efficient algorithms for separable convex problems [4, 26, 22, 30], which can thus be used\\nas inner loops in more general convex problems by using projected gradient methods (see, e.g., [3]).\\nIn this paper, we show that another form of structure can be leveraged. We will assume that H is\\nsubmodular, which is equivalent, when twice continuously differentiable, to having nonpositive cross\\nsecond-order derivatives. This notably includes all (potentially non convex) separable functions (i.e.,\\nsums of functions that depend on single variables), but also many other examples (see Section 2).\\nMinimizing submodular functions on continuous domains has been recently shown to be equivalent\\nto a convex optimization problem on a space of uni-dimensional measures [2], and given that the\\nfunctions x 7! (xj xi )+ are submodular for any > 0, it is natural that by using tending to +1,\\n32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018), Montréal, Canada.\\n\\n\\x0cwe recover as well a convex optimization problem; the main contribution of this paper is to provide a\\nsimple framework based on stochastic dominance, for which we design efficient algorithms which\\nare based on simple oracles on the function H (typically access to function values and derivatives).\\nIn order to obtain such algorithms, we go significantly beyond [2] by introducing novel discretization\\nalgorithms that also provide improvements without any isotonic constraints.\\nMore precisely, we make the following contributions:\\n– We show in Section 3 that minimizing a submodular function with isotonic constraints can be\\ncast as a convex optimization problem on a space of uni-dimensional measures, with isotonic\\nconstraints corresponding to first-order stochastic dominance.\\n– On top of the naive discretization schemes presented in Section 4, we propose in Section 5 new\\ndiscretization schemes that lead to simple and efficient algorithms based on zero-th, first, or\\nhigher order oracles. They go from requiring O(1/\"3 ) = O(1/\"2+1 ) function evaluations to\\nreach a precision \", to O(1/\"5/2 ) = O(1/\"2+1/2 ) and O(1/\"7/3 ) = O(1/\"2+1/3 ).\\n– Our experiments in Section 6 show that non-convex loss functions can be much more robust to\\noutliers for isotonic regression.\\n\\n2\\n\\nSubmodular Analysis in Continuous Domains\\n\\nIn this section, we review the framework of [2] that shows how to minimize submodular functions\\nusing convex optimization.\\nDefinition. Throughout this paper, we consider a continuous function H : [0, 1]n ! R. The\\nfunction H is said to be submodular if and only if [21, 29]:\\n8(x, y) 2 [0, 1]n ⇥ [0, 1]n , H(x) + H(y) > H(min{x, y}) + H(max{x, y}),\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere the min and max operations are applied component-wise. If H is continuously twice differen2\\nH\\ntiable, then this is equivalent to @x@i @x\\n(x) 6 0 for any i 6= j and x 2 [0, 1]n [29].\\nj\\nThe cone of submodular functions on [0, 1]n is invariant by marginal strictly increasing transformations, and includes all functions that depend on a single variable (which play the role of linear\\nfunctions for convex functions), which we refer to as separable functions.\\nExamples. The classical examples are: (a) any separable function, (b) convex functions of the\\ndifference of two components, (c) concave functions of a positive linear combination, (d) negative\\nlog densities of multivariate totally positive distributions [17]. See Section 6 for a concrete example.\\nExtension on a space of measures. We consider the convex set P([0, 1]) of Radon probability\\nmeasures [24] on [0, 1], which is the closure (for the weak topology) of the convex hull of all Dirac\\nmeasures. In order to get an extension, we look for a function defined on the set of products of\\nprobability measures µ 2 P([0, 1])n , such that if all µi , i = 1, . . . , n, are Dirac measures at points\\nxi 2 [0, 1], then we have a function value equal to H(x1 , . . . , xn ). Note that P([0, 1])n is different\\nfrom P([0, 1]n ), which is the set of probability measures on [0, 1]n .\\nFor a probability distribution µi 2 P([0, 1]) defined on [0, 1], we can define the (reversed) cumulative\\ndistribution function Fµi : [0, 1] ! [0, 1] as Fµi (xi ) = µi [xi , 1] . This is a non-increasing\\nleft-continuous function from [0, 1] to [0, 1], such that Fµi (0) = 1 and Fµi (1) = µi ({1}). See\\nillustrations in the left plot of Figure 1.\\nWe can then define the “inverse” cumulative function from [0, 1] to [0, 1] as Fµi1 (ti ) = sup{xi 2\\n[0, 1], Fµi (xi ) > ti }. The function Fµi1 is non-increasing and right-continuous, and such that\\nFµi1 (1) = min supp(µi ) and Fµi1 (0) = 1. Moreover, we have Fµi (xi ) > ti , Fµi1 (ti ) > xi .\\n\\nThe extension from [0, 1]n to the set of product probability measures is obtained by considering a\\nsingle threshold t applied to all n cumulative distribution functions, that is:\\nZ 1\\n⇥\\n⇤\\n8µ 2 P([0, 1])n , h(µ1 , . . . , µn ) =\\nH Fµ11 (t), . . . , Fµn1 (t) dt.\\n(3)\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\n3\\n\\n1.5\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nµ\\n−1\\nFµ\\n\\nF\\n\\nν\\nµ\\n\\n2\\nν\\nµ\\n\\nµ\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n0.5\\n0\\n0\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n1\\n\\nFigure 1: Left: cumulative and inverse cumulative distribution functions with the corresponding\\ndensity (with respect to the Lebesgue measure). Right: cumulative functions for two distributions µ\\nand ⌫ such that µ < ⌫.\\nWe have the following properties when H is submodular: (a) it is an extension, that is, if for all i, µi\\nis a Dirac at xi , then h(µ) = H(x); (b) it is convex; (c) minimizing h on P([0, 1])n and minimizing\\nn\\nH\\nmoreover, the minimal values are equal and µ is a minimizer if and only if\\n⇥ on1 [0, 1] is equivalent;\\n⇤\\nFµ1 (t), . . . , Fµn1 (t) is a minimizer of H for almost all t 2 [0, 1]. Thus, submodular minimization\\nis equivalent to a convex optimization problem in a space of uni-dimensional measures.\\n\\nNote that the extension is defined on all tuples of measures µ = (µ1 , . . . , µn ) but it can equivalently\\nbe defined through non-increasing functions from [0, 1] to [0, 1], e.g., the representation in terms of\\ncumulative distribution functions Fµi defined above (this representation will be used in Section 4\\nwhere algorithms based on the discretization of the equivalent obtained convex problem are discussed).\\n\\n3\\n\\nIsotonic Constraints and Stochastic Dominance\\n\\nIn this paper, we consider the following problem:\\ninf\\n\\nx2[0,1]n\\n\\nH(x) such that 8(i, j) 2 E, xi > xj ,\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere E is the edge set of a directed acyclic graph on {1, . . . , n} and H is submodular. We denote\\nby X ⇢ Rn (not necessarily a subset of [0, 1]n ) the set of x 2 Rn satisfying the isotonic constraints.\\nIn order to define an extension in a space of measures, we consider a specific order on measures\\non [0, 1], namely first-order stochastic dominance [20], defined as follows.\\n\\nGiven two distributions µ and ⌫ on [0, 1], with (inverse) cumulative distribution functions Fµ and F⌫ ,\\nwe have µ < ⌫, if and only if 8x 2 [0, 1], Fµ (x) > F⌫ (x), or equivalently, 8t 2 [0, 1], Fµ 1 (t) >\\nF⌫ 1 (t). As shown in the right plot of Figure 1, the densities may still overlap. An equivalent\\ncharacterization [19, 9] is the existence of a joint distribution on a vector (X, X 0 ) 2 R2 with\\nmarginals µ(x) and ⌫(x0 ) and such that X > X 0 almost surely1 . We now prove the main proposition\\nof the paper:\\nProposition 1 We consider the convex minimization problem:\\ninf\\n\\nµ2P([0,1])n\\n\\nh(µ) such that 8(i, j) 2 E, µi < µj .\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nProblems in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) have the same objective values. Moreover, µ is a minimizer of Eq. (5)\\nif and only if Fµ 1 (t) is a minimizer of H of Eq. (4) for almost all t 2 [0, 1].\\nProof We denote by M the set of µ 2 P([0, 1])n satisfying the stochastic ordering constraints. For\\nany x 2 [0, 1]n that satisfies the constraints in Eq. (4), i.e., x 2 X \\\\ [0, 1]n , the associated Dirac\\nmeasures satisfy the constraint in Eq. (5). Therefore, the objective value M of Eq. (4) is greater or\\nequal to the one M 0 of Eq. (5). Given a minimizer µ for the convex problem in Eq. (5), we have:\\n⇤\\nR1 ⇥\\nR1\\nM > M 0 = h(µ) = 0 H Fµ11 (t), . . . , Fµn1 (t) dt > 0 M dt = M. This shows the proposition by\\nstudying the equality cases above.\\n1\\n\\nSuch a joint distribution may be built as the distribution of (Fµ 1 (T ), F⌫ 1 (T )), where T is uniformly\\ndistributed in [0, 1].\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cR +1\\nP\\nAlternatively, we could add the penalty term\\n(Fµj (z) Fµi (z))+ dz, which corre(i,j)2E\\nP 1\\nsponds to the unconstrained minimization of H(x) +\\nxi )+ . For > 0 big enough2 ,\\n(i,j)2E (xj\\nthis is equivalent to the problem above, but with a submodular function which has a large Lipschitz\\nconstant (and is thus harder to optimize with the iterative methods presented below).\\n\\n4\\n\\nDiscretization algorithms\\n\\nProp. 1 shows that the isotonic regression problem with a submodular cost can be cast as a convex\\noptimization problem; however, this is achieved in a space of measures, which cannot be handled\\ndirectly computationally in polynomial time. Following [2], we consider a polynomial time and\\nspace discretization scheme of each interval [0, 1] (and not of [0, 1]n ), but we propose in Section 5\\na significant improvement that allows to reduce the number of discrete points significantly. All\\npseudo-codes for the algorithms are available in Appendix B.\\n4.1\\n\\nReview of submodular optimization in discrete domains\\n\\nAll our algorithms will end up minimizing approximately a submodular function F on {0, . . . , k 1}n ,\\nthat is, which satisfies Eq. (2). Isotonic constraints will be added in Section 4.2.\\nFollowing [2], this can be formulated as minimizing a convex function f# on the set of ⇢ 2\\n[0, 1]n⇥(k 1) so that for each i 2 {1, . . . , n}, (⇢ij )j2{1,...,k 1} is a non-increasing sequence (we\\ndenote by S this set of constraints) corresponding to the cumulative distribution function. For any\\nfeasible ⇢, a subgradient of f# may be computed by sorting all n(k 1) elements of the matrix ⇢ and\\ncomputing at most n(k 1) values of F . An approximate minimizer of F (which exactly inherits\\napproximation properties from the approximate optimality of ⇢) is then obtained by selecting the\\nminimum value of F in the computation of the subgradient. Projected subgradient methods can\\nthen be used, and if F is the largest absolute difference in values of F when a single variablepis\\nchanged by ±1, we obtain an \"-minimizer (for function values) after t iterations, with \" 6 nk F / t.\\nThe projection step is composed of n simple separable quadratic isotonic regressions with chain\\nconstraints in dimension k, which can be solved easily in O(nk) using the pool-adjacent-violator\\nalgorithm [4]. Computing a subgradient requires a sorting operation, which is thus O(nk log(nk)).\\nSee more details in [2].\\nAlternatively, we can minimize the strongly-convex f# (⇢) + 12 k⇢k2F on the set of ⇢ 2 Rn⇥(k 1) so\\nthat for each i, (⇢ij )j is a non-increasing sequence, that is, ⇢ 2 S (the constraints that ⇢ij 2 [0, 1]\\nare dropped). We then get a minimizer z of F by looking for all i 2 {1, . . . , n} at the largest\\nj 2 {1, . . . , k 1} such that ⇢ij > 0. We take\\np then zi = j (and if no such j exists, zi = 0). A gap\\nof \" in the problem above, leads to a gap of \"nk for the original problem (see more details in [2]).\\nThe subgradient method in the primal, or Frank-Wolfe algorithm in the dual may be used for this\\nproblem. We obtain an \"-minimizer (for function values) after t iterations, with \" 6 F /t, which\\nleads for the original submodular minimization problem to the same optimality guarantees as above,\\nbut with a faster algorithm in practice. See the detailed computations and comparisons in [2].\\n4.2\\n\\nNaive discretization scheme\\n\\nFollowing [2], we simply discretize [0, 1] by selecting the k values k i 1 or 2i+1\\n2k , for i 2 {0, . . . , k\\n1}. If the function H : [0, 1]n is L1 -Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the `1 -norm, that is\\n|H(x) H(x0 )| 6 L1 kx x0 k1 , the function F is (L1 /k)-Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the\\n`1 -norm (and thus we have F 6 L1 /k above). Moreover, if F is minimized up to \", H is optimized\\nup to \" + nL1 /k.\\nIn order to take into account the isotonic constraints, we simply minimize with respect to ⇢ 2\\n[0, 1]n⇥(k 1) \\\\ S, with the additional constraint that for all j 2 {1, . . . , k 1}, 8(a, b) 2 E,\\n⇢a,j > ⇢b,j . This corresponds to additional contraints T ⇢ Rn⇥(k 1) .\\n2\\nA short calculation shows that when H is differentiable, the first order-optimality condition (which is only\\nnecessary here) implies that if is strictly larger than n times the largest possible partial first-order derivative\\nof H, the isotonic constraints have to be satisfied.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cFollowing Section 4.1, we can either choose to solve the convex problem min⇢2[0,1]n⇥k \\\\S\\\\T f# (⇢),\\nor the strongly-convex problem min⇢2S\\\\T f# (⇢) + 12 k⇢k2F . In the two situations, after t iterations,\\nthat is tnk accesses to values\\nof H, we get a constrained minimizer of H with approximation\\np\\nguarantee nL1 /k + nL1 / t. Thus in order to get a precision \", it suffices to select k > 2nL1 /\" and\\nt > 4n2 L21 /\"2 , leading to an overall 8n4 L31 /\"3 accesses to function values of H, which is the same\\nas obtained in [2] (except for an extra factor of n due to a different definition of L1 ).\\n4.3\\n\\nImproved behavior for smooth functions\\n\\nWe consider the discretization points k i 1 for i 2 {0, . . . , k 1}, and we assume that all first-order\\n(resp. second-order) partial derivatives are bounded by L1 (resp. L22 ). In the reasoning above, we may\\nupper-bound the infimum of the discrete function in a finer way, going from inf x2X H(x) + nL1 /k\\nto inf x2X H(x) + 12 n2 L22 /k 2 (by doing a Taylor expansion around the global optimum, where the\\nfirst-order terms are always\\np zero, either because the partial derivative is zero or the deviation is zero).\\nWe now select k >pnL2 / \", leading to a number of accesses to H that scales as 4n4 L21 L2 /\"5/2 . We\\nthus gain a factor \" with the exact same algorithm, but different assumptions.\\n4.4\\n\\nAlgorithms for isotonic problem\\n\\nCompared to plain submodular minimization where we need to project onto S, we need to take into\\naccount the extra isotonic constraints, i.e., ⇢ 2 T, and thus use more complex orthogonal projections.\\nOrthogonal projections. We now require the orthogonal projections on S \\\\ T or [0, 1]n⇥k \\\\ S \\\\ T,\\nwhich are themselves isotonic regression problems with nk variables. If there are m original isotonic\\nconstraints in Eq. (4), the number of isotonic constraints for the projection step is O(nk + mk), which\\nis typically O(mk) if m > n, which we now assume. Thus, we can use existing parametric max-flow\\nalgorithms which can solve these in O(nmk 2 log(nk)) [13] or in O(nmk 2 log(n2 k/m)) [11]. See\\nin Appendix A a description of the reformulation of isotonic regression as a parametric max-flow\\nproblem, and the link with minimum cut. Following [7, Prop. 5.3], we incorporate the [0, 1] box\\nconstraints, by first ignoring them and thus by projecting onto the regular isotonic constraints, and\\nthen thresholding the result through x ! max{min{x, 1}, 0}.\\nAlternatively, we can explicitly consider a sequence of max-flow problems (with at most log(1/\") of\\nthese, where \" is the required precision) [28, 15]. Finally, we may consider (approximate) alternate\\nprojection algorithms such as Dykstra’s algorithm and its accelerated variants [6], since the set S is\\neasy to project to, while, in some cases, such as chain isotonic constraints for the original problem, T\\nis easy to project to.\\n\\nFinally, we could also use algorithms dedicated to special structures for isotonic regression (see [27]),\\nin particular when our original set of isotonic constraints in Eq. (4) is a chain, and the orthogonal\\nprojection corresponds to a two-dimensional grid [26]. In our experiments, we use a standard\\nmax-flow code [5] and the usual divide-and-conquer algorithms [28, 15] for parametric max-flow.\\nSeparable problems. The function f# from Section 4.2 is then a linear function of the form\\nf# (⇢) = tr w> ⇢, and then, a single max-flow algorithm can be used.\\nFor these separable problerms, the alternative strongly-convex problem of minimizing f# (⇢) + 12 k⇢k2F\\nbecomes the one of minimizing min⇢2S\\\\T 12 k⇢ + wk2F , which is simply the problem of projecting\\non the intersection of two convex sets, for which an accelerated Dykstra algorithm may be used [6],\\nwith convergence rate in O(1/t2 ) after t iterations. Each step is O(kn) for projecting onto S, while\\nthis is k parametric network flows with n variables and m constraints for projecting onto T, in\\nO(knm log n) for the general case and O(kn) for chains and rooted trees [4, 30].\\nIn our experiments in Section 6, we show that Dykstra’s algorithm converges quickly for separable\\nproblems. Note that when the underlying losses are convex3 , then Dykstra converges in a single\\niteration. Indeed, in this situation, the sequences ( wij )j are non-increasing and isotonic regression\\n3\\n\\nThis is a situation where direct algorithms such as the ones by [22] are much more efficient than our\\ndiscretization schemes.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0calong a direction preserves decreasingness in the other direction, which implies that after two alternate\\nprojections, the algorithm has converged to the optimal solution.\\nAlternatively, for the non-strongly convex formulation, this is a single network flow problem with\\nn(k 1) nodes, and mk constraints, in thus O(nmk 2 log(nk)) [25]. When E corresponds to a chain,\\nthen this is a 2-dimensional-grid with an algorithm in O(n2 k 2 ) [26]. For a precision \", and thus k\\nproportional to n/\" with the assumptions of Section 4.2, this makes a number of function calls for H,\\n3\\n2\\n2\\nequal to O(kn) = O(n2 /\") and a running-time complexity of O(n\\np m/\" · log(n /\"))—for smooth\\nfunctions, as shown in Section 4.3, we get k proportional to n/ \" and thus an improved behavior.\\n\\n5\\n\\nImproved discretization algorithms\\n\\nWe now consider a different discretization scheme that can take advantage of access to higher-order\\nderivatives. We divide [0, 1] into k disjoint pieces A0 = [0, k1 ), A1 = [ k1 , k2 ), . . . , Ak 1 = [ k k 1 , 1].\\nThis defines a new function H̃ : {0, . . . , k 1}n ! R defined only for elements z 2 {0, . . . , k 1}n\\nthat satisfy the isotonic constraint, i.e., z 2 {0, . . . , k 1}n \\\\ X:\\nH̃(z) =\\n\\nx2\\n\\nmin\\nQ\\nn\\ni=1\\n\\nAz i\\n\\nH(x) such that 8(i, j) 2 E, xi > xj .\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nThe function H̃(z) is equal to +1 if z does not satisfy the isotonic constraints.\\nProposition 2 The function H̃ is submodular, and minimizing H̃(z) for z 2 {0, . . . , k\\nthat 8(i, j) 2 E, zi > zj is equivalent to minimizing Eq. (4).\\n\\n1}n such\\n\\nProof We consider z and z 0 that satisfy the isotonic constraints, with minimizers x and x0 in the definition in Eq. (6). We have H(z) + H(z 0 ) = H(x) + H(x0 ) > H(min{x, x0 }) + H(max{x, x0 }) >\\nH(min{z, z 0 }) + H(max{z, z 0 }). Thus it is submodular on the sub-lattice {0, . . . , k 1}n \\\\ X.\\nNote that in order to minimize H̃, we need to make sure that we only access H for elements z that\\nsatisfy the isotonic constraints, that is ⇢ 2 S \\\\ T (which our algorithms impose).\\n5.1\\n\\nApproximation from high-order smoothness\\n\\nThe main idea behind our discretization scheme is to use high-order smoothness to approximate for\\nany required z, the function value H̃(z). If we assume that H is q-times differentiable, with uniform\\nbounds Lrr on all r-th order derivatives, then, the (q 1)-th order Taylor expansion of H around y is\\nPq 1 P\\n1\\nequal to Hq (x|y) = H(y) + r=1 |↵|=r ↵!\\n(x y)↵ H (↵) (y), where ↵ 2 Nn and |↵| is the sum\\n↵\\nof elements, (x y) is the vector with components (xi yi )↵i , ↵! the products of all factorials of\\nelements of ↵, and H (↵) (y) is the partial derivative of H with order ↵i for each i.\\nWe thus approximate H̃(z), for any z that satisfies the isotonic constraint (i.e., z 2 X), by Ĥ(z) =\\nminx2(Qni=1 Azi )\\\\X Hq (x| z+1/2\\nĤ(z)| 6 (nLq /2k)q /q!. Moreover,\\nk ). We have for any z, |H̃(z)\\nwhen moving a single element of z by one, the maximal deviation is L1 /k + 2(nLq /2k)q /q!.\\nIf Ĥ is submodular,\\nthen the same reasoning as in Section 4.2 leads to an approximate erp\\nror of (nk/ t) L1 /k + 2(nLq /2k)q /q! after t iterations, on top of (nLq /2k)q /q!, thus, with\\nt > 16n2 L21 /\"2 and k > (q!\"/2) 1/q nLq /2 (assuming \" small enough such that t > 16n2 k 2 ), this\\nleads to a number of accesses to the (q 1)-th order oracle equal to O(n4 L21 Lq /\"2+1/q ). We thus get\\nan improvement in the power of \", which tend to \" 2 for infinitely smooth problems. Note that when\\nq = 1 we recover the same rate as in Section 4.3 (with the same assumptions but a slightly different\\nalgorithm).\\nHowever, unless q = 1, the function Ĥ(z) is not submodular, and we cannot apply directly the\\nbounds for convex optimization of the extension. We show in Appendix D that the bound still holds\\nfor q > 1 by using the special structure of the convex problem.\\nWhat remains unknown is the computation of Ĥ which requires to minimize polynomials on a small\\ncube. We can always use the generic algorithms from Section 4.2 for this, which do not access extra\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cfunction values but can be slow. For quadratic functions, we can use a convex relaxation which is\\nnot tight but already allows strong improvements with much faster local steps, and which we now\\npresent. See the pseudo-code in Appendix B. In any case, using expansions of higher order is only\\npractically useful in situations where function evaluations are expensive.\\n5.2\\n\\nQuadratic problems\\n\\nIn this section, we consider the minimization of a quadratic submodular function H(x) = 12 x> Ax +\\nc> x (thus with all off-diagonal elements of A non-negative) on [0, 1]n , subject to isotonic constraints\\nxi > xj for all (i, j) 2 E. This is the sub-problem required in Section 5.1 when using second-order\\nTaylor expansions.\\nIt could be solved iteratively (and approximately) with the algorithm from Section 4.2; in this\\nsection, we consider a semidefinite relaxation which is tight for certain problems (A positive semidefinite, c non-positive, or A with non-positive diagonal elements), but not in general (we have found\\ncounter-examples but it is most often tight).\\nThe relaxation is based on considering the set of (Y, y) 2 Rn⇥n ⇥ Rn such that there exists\\nx 2 [0, 1]n \\\\ X with Y = xx> and y = x. Our problem is thus equivalent to minimizing\\n1\\n>\\n2 tr AY + c y such that (Y, y) is in the convex-hull Y of this set, which is NP-hard to characterize\\nin polynomial time [10]. However, following ideas from [18], we can\\n! find a simple relaxation by\\nYii Yij yi\\nconsidering the following constraints: (a) for all i 6= j, Yij Yjj yj is positive semi-definite, (b)\\ny i yj 1\\nfor all i 6= j, Yij 6 inf{yi , yj }, which corresponds to xi xj 6 inf{xi , xj } for any x 2 [0, 1]n , (c)\\nfor all i, Yii 6 yi , which corresponds to x2i 6 xi , and (d) for all (i, j) 2 E, yi > yj , Yii > Yjj ,\\nYij > max{Yjj , yj yi + Yii } and Yij 6 max{Yii , yi yj + Yjj }, which corresponds to xi > xj ,\\nx2i > x2j , xi xj > x2j , xi (1 xi ) 6 xi (1 xj ), xi xj 6 x2i , and xi (1 xj ) > xj (1 xj ). This\\nleads to a semi-definite program which provides a lower-bound on the optimal value of the problem.\\nSee Appendix E for a proof of tightness for special cases and a counter-example for the tightness in\\ngeneral.\\n\\n6\\n\\nExperiments\\n\\nWe consider experiments aiming at (a) showing that the new possibility of minimizing submodular\\nfunctions with isotonic constraints brings new possibilities and (b) that the new discretization\\nalgorithms are faster than the naive one.\\nn\\nRobust\\nH(x) =\\nPn isotonic regression. Given some z 2 R , we consider a separable1 function\\n1\\nG(x\\nz\\n)\\nwith\\nvarious\\npossibilities\\nfor\\nG:\\n(a) the square loss G(t) = 2 t2 , (b) the absolute\\ni\\ni\\ni=1\\nn\\n2\\nloss G(t) = |t| and (c) a logarithmic loss G(t) = \\uf8ff2 log 1 + t2 /\\uf8ff2 , which is the negative logdensity of a Student distribution and non-convex. The non-convexity of the cost function and the fact\\nthat is has vanishing derivatives for large values make it a good candidate for robust estimation [12].\\nThe first two losses may be dealt with methods for separable convex isotonic regression [22, 30], but\\nthe non-convex loss can only dealt with exactly by the new optimization routine that we present—\\nmajorization-minimization algorithms [14] based on the concavity of G as a function of t2 can be\\nused with such non-convex losses, but as shown below, they converge to bad local optima.\\n\\nFor simplicity, we consider chain constraints 1 > x1 > x2 > · · · > xn > 0. We consider two\\nset-ups: (a) a separable set-up where maximum flow algorithms can be used directly (with n = 200),\\nand (b) a general submodular set-up (with n = 25 and n = 200), where we add a smoothness penalty\\nPn 1\\nwhich is the sum of terms of the form 2 i=1 (xi xi+1 )2 , which is submodular (but not separable).\\nData generation. We generate the data z 2 Rn , with n = 200, as follows: we first generate a\\nsimple decreasing function of i 2 {1, . . . , n} (here an affine function); we then perturb this ground\\ntruth by (a) adding some independent noise and (b) corrupting the data by changing a random subset\\nof the n values by the application of another function which is increasing (see Figure 2, left). This\\nis an adversarial perturbation, while the independent noise is not adversarial; the presence of the\\nadversarial noise makes the problem harder as the proportion of corrupted data increases.\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c0.6\\n\\nlog10(mean square error)\\n\\nobservations − fits\\n\\nProp. of corrupted data = 50 %\\n0.7\\n\\nsquare\\nabsolute\\nlogarithm\\n\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n0\\n\\n100\\nindex i\\n\\n200\\n\\n0\\n−1\\n\\nsquare\\nabsolute\\nlogarithm 0.01\\nlogarithm 0.001\\n\\n−2\\n0\\n0.5\\n1\\nproportion of outliers\\n\\nFigure 2: Left: robust isotonic regression with decreasing constraints, with 50% of corrupted data\\n(observation in pink crosses, and results of isotonic regression with various losses in red, blue and\\nblack); the dashed black line corresponds to majorization-minimization algorithm started from the\\nobservations. Right: robustness of various losses to the proportion of corrupted data. The two\\nlogarithm-based losses are used with two values of \\uf8ff (0.01 and 0.001); the dashed line corresponds to\\nthe majorization-minimization algorithm (with no convergence guarantees and worse performance).\\n\\nOptimization of separable problems with maximum flow algorithms. We solve the discretized\\nversion by a single maximum-flow problem of size nk. We compare the various losses for k = 1000\\non data which is along a decreasing line (plus noise), but corrupted (i.e., replaced for a certain\\nproportion) by data along an increasing line. See an example in the left plot of Figure 2 for 50% of\\ncorrupted data. We see that the square loss is highly non robust, while the (still convex) absolute loss\\nis slightly more robust, and the robust non-convex loss still approximates the decreasing function\\ncorrectly with 50% of corrupted data when optimized globally, while the method with no guarantee\\n(based on majorization-minimization, dashed line) does not converge to an acceptable solution. In\\nAppendix C, we show additional examples where it is robust up to 75% of corruption.\\nIn the right plot of Figure 2, we also show the robustness to an increasing proportion of outliers\\n(for the same type of data as for the left plot), by plotting the mean-squared error in log-scale and\\naveraged over 20 replications. Overall, this shows the benefits of non-convex isotonic regression with\\nguaranteed global optimization, even for large proportions of corrupted data.\\nOptimization of separable problems with pool-adjacent violator (PAV) algorithm. As shown\\nin Section 4.2, discretized separable submodular optimization corresponds to the orthogonal projection\\nof a matrix into the intersection of chain isotonic constraints in each row, and isotonic constraints\\nin each column equal to the original set of isotonic constraints (in these simulations, these are also\\nchain constraints). This can be done by Dykstra’s alternating projection algorithm or its accelerated\\nversion [6], for which each projection step can be performed with the PAV algorithm because each of\\nthem corresponds to chain constraints.\\nIn the left plot of Figure 3, we show the difference in function values (in log-scale) for various\\ndiscretization levels (defined by the integer k spaced by 1/4 in base-10 logarithm), as as function of\\nthe number of iterations (averaged over 20 replications). For large k (small difference of function\\nvalues), we see a spacing between the ends of the plots of approximatively 1/2, highlighting the\\ndependence in 1/k 2 of the final error with discretization k, which our analysis in Section 4.3 suggests.\\nEffect of the discretization for separable problems. In order to highlight the effect of discretization and its interplay with differentiability properties of the function to minimize, we consider in\\nthe middle plot of Figure 3, the distance in function values after full optimization of the discrete\\nsubmodular function for various values of k. We see that for the simple smooth function (quadratic\\nloss), we have a decay in 1/k 2 , while for the simple non smooth function (absolute loss), we have a\\nfinal decay in 1/k), a predicted by our analysis. For the logarithm-based loss, whose smoothness\\nconstant depends on \\uf8ff, when \\uf8ff is large, it behaves like a smooth function immediately, while for \\uf8ff\\nsmaller, k needs to be large enough to reach that behavior.\\nNon-separable problems. We consider adding a smoothness penalty to add the prior knowledge\\nthat values should be decreasing and close. In Appendix C, we show the effect of adding a smoothness\\nprior (for n = 200): it leads to better estimation. In the right plot of Figure 3, we show the effect\\nof various discretization schemes (for n = 25), from order 0 (naive discretization), to order 1 and 2\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cEffect of discretization\\n0\\nlog10(∆ H)\\n\\nlog10(∆ H)\\n\\n−4\\n−5\\n−6\\n−7\\n0\\n\\n10\\n20\\n30\\nNumber of iterations\\n\\n−2\\n−4\\n−6\\n1\\n\\n0\\nsquare\\nabsolute\\nlogarithm 0.1\\nlogarithm 0.001\\n\\nlog10(∆ H)\\n\\nDykstra\\n−3\\n\\n−2\\n−4\\n−6\\n1\\n\\n2\\n3\\nlog10(k)\\n\\norder 0\\norder 1\\norder 2\\n\\n1.5\\nlog10(k)\\n\\n2\\n\\nFigure 3: Dykstra’s projection algorithms for separable problems, with several values of k, spaced\\nwith 1/4 in base-10 logarithm, from 10 1 to 10 3.5 .

Middle: effect of discretization value k for various loss functions for separable problems (the\\nlogarithm-based loss is considered with two values of \\uf8ff, \\uf8ff = 0.1 and \\uf8ff = 0.001). Right: effect of\\ndiscretization k on non-separable problems.\\n\\n(our new schemes based on Taylor expansions from Section 5.1), and we plot the difference in\\nfunction values after 50 steps of subgradient descent: in each plot, the quantity H is equal to\\nH(x⇤k ) H ⇤ , where x⇤k is an approximate minimizer of the discretized problem with k values and\\nH ⇤ the minimum of H (taking into account the isotonic constraints). As outlined in our analysis, the\\nfirst-order scheme does not help because our function has bounded Hessians, while the second-order\\ndoes so significantly.\\n\\n7\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we have shown how submodularity could be leveraged to obtain polynomial-time\\nalgorithms for isotonic regressions with a submodular cost, based on convex optimization in a space\\nof measures—although based on convexity arguments, our algorithms apply to all separable nonconvex functions. The final algorithms are based on discretization, with a new scheme that also\\nprovides improvements based on smoothness (also without isotonic constraints). Our framework is\\nworth extending in the following directions: (a) we currently consider a fixed discretization, it would\\nbe advantageous to consider adaptive schemes, potentially improving the dependence on the number\\nof variables n and the precision \"; (b) other shape constraints can be consider in a similar submodular\\nframework, such as xi xj > 0 for certain pairs (i, j); (c) a direct convex formulation without\\ndiscretization could probably be found for quadratic programming with submodular costs (which are\\npotentially non-convex but solvable in polynomial time); (d) a statistical study of isotonic regression\\nwith adversarial corruption could now rely on formulations with polynomial-time algorithms.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe acknowledge support the European Research Council (grant SEQUOIA 724063).\\n\\n'"
